# Circuit Breaker Demo - Quick Checklist

## ‚úÖ Pre-Demo Setup

- [ ] All 3 backend services running (UserService:5001, ReadingService:5002, ComicService:5003)
- [ ] Frontend running (http://localhost:5173)
- [ ] At least one user registered in the system
- [ ] At least one comic with chapters in the database
- [ ] Browser DevTools ready (F12, Network tab open)
- [ ] Terminal windows visible for logs

## üé¨ Demo Flow (5-10 minutes)

### Part 1: Normal Operation (2 min)
- [ ] Login to the application
- [ ] Browse to comics list
- [ ] Click on a comic to see details
- [ ] **Point out:** Total Reads, Unique Readers, Active Readers stats
- [ ] **Explain:** "These stats come from ReadingService via circuit breaker"

### Part 2: Service Failure (3 min)
- [ ] Stop ReadingService (Ctrl+C in Terminal 2)
- [ ] **Say:** "Watch what happens when ReadingService goes down..."
- [ ] Refresh comic details page
- [ ] **Point out:**
  - [ ] Page still loads (no crash!)
  - [ ] Stats show as 0 (fallback values)
  - [ ] No long delays or hanging
  - [ ] ComicService logs show "CIRCUIT BREAKER OPEN" üî¥
- [ ] **Explain:** "Circuit breaker prevented cascading failure"

### Part 3: Multiple Failures (2 min)
- [ ] Click on different comics (3-5 times)
- [ ] **Point out in logs:**
  - [ ] First few requests try and fail
  - [ ] After 3 failures, circuit opens
  - [ ] Subsequent requests fail immediately (fast fail)
  - [ ] "See how it stops trying? That's the circuit breaker protecting our system"

### Part 4: Service Recovery (2 min)
- [ ] Restart ReadingService
- [ ] **Say:** "Now let's bring the service back..."
- [ ] Wait a few seconds
- [ ] Browse to a comic
- [ ] **Point out:**
  - [ ] Stats are back! ‚úÖ
  - [ ] Circuit automatically closed
  - [ ] Logs show "Stats fetched successfully"
  - [ ] "The circuit breaker detected the service is healthy and closed automatically"

### Part 5: Wrap-Up (1 min)
- [ ] **Summarize benefits:**
  - [ ] "No cascading failures"
  - [ ] "Fast failure detection"  
  - [ ] "Automatic recovery"
  - [ ] "Great user experience"
  - [ ] "Production-ready resilience"

## üé§ Key Talking Points

1. **What is Circuit Breaker?**
   - "Like an electrical circuit breaker - stops the flow when there's a problem"
   - "Prevents one failing service from taking down the whole system"

2. **Three States:**
   - CLOSED (green): Everything normal ‚úÖ
   - OPEN (red): Service is down, fail fast üî¥
   - HALF-OPEN (yellow): Testing if service recovered üü°

3. **Configuration:**
   - Monitors failures for 10 seconds
   - Opens circuit if 50% requests fail
   - Needs at least 3 requests to decide
   - Stays open for 30 seconds before retrying
   - Automatic retry (2 attempts)
   - Timeout protection (3 seconds)

4. **Real-World Value:**
   - "Imagine Black Friday - one service failing shouldn't crash everything"
   - "Circuit breaker gives the failing service time to recover"
   - "Users get graceful degradation instead of errors"

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**If stats don't show even when all services are running:**
- Check if comics have been read (need actual reading data)
- Check database connections
- Verify service URLs in appsettings.json

**If circuit doesn't open:**
- Make sure you click enough times (need 3+ requests)
- Check circuit breaker config in DependencyInjection.cs
- Watch the logs carefully

**If service doesn't recover:**
- Wait full 30 seconds after restarting
- Make a new request to test recovery
- Check if service is actually running

## üì∏ Screenshots to Capture

1. Comic details WITH stats (all services running)
2. Comic details WITHOUT stats (ReadingService down)
3. ComicService logs showing "CIRCUIT BREAKER OPEN"
4. Browser Network tab showing fast failures
5. Recovery - stats coming back

## üéØ Success Indicators

You know the demo worked when:
- ‚úÖ Audience sees the app keeps working when service is down
- ‚úÖ Logs clearly show circuit breaker messages
- ‚úÖ Stats gracefully degrade to 0 instead of errors
- ‚úÖ Fast failures prevent system overload
- ‚úÖ Automatic recovery demonstrates self-healing
- ‚úÖ Everyone says "Wow, that's really useful!"

---

**Pro Tip:** Practice this flow 2-3 times before the actual demo to nail the timing!

Good luck with your demonstration! üöÄ
